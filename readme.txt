Inspired by Yelp compliments system BuddyPress Compliments is a BuddyPress addon that allows members to compliment each other. 

== Description ==

BuddyPress compliments adds a smart way for BuddyPress members to interact with each other via compliments.

* Install the plugin
* Create unlimited number of Compliment types (eg: Thank you - Good Writer - Cute Pic - Like your Profile - etc.)
* A Compliment button and Compliments tab will appear in each member's profile.
* When you click the Compliments button, a popup will show up with compliment types
* Submitted compliments will be visible in user's compliments section.

We built this plugin especially for Whoop! our upcoming WordPress Directory Theme powered by [GeoDirectory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/geodirectory/ "Whoop! is a GeoDirectory theme and it will be released soon"). 

We decided to release BuddyPress Compliments for free, while we give the final touches to Whoop! so that any BuddyPress users can take advantage of it.

The plugins has been tested with the following themes before release:

Twenty Thirteen, Twenty Fourteen, Twenty Fifteen, GeoDIrectory Framework and Whoop! of course.
